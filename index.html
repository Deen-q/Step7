      <p>Here are a handful of interesting facts surrounding Great White Sharks:</p>
        
      <div id="list-div">
      <ul>
        <li> Great White Sharks are second only to Whale Sharks, in terms of sheer size
        <li> They are however, the largest predatory fish, averaging 4.5 meters long and up to 3,32kg.
    
        <li> Some Great Whites have measured over 8m!
    
          <li>Great Whites reach adulthood at around 9 years old, with some living over 70 years old
      </ul>
      </div>
       
       <p>Perhaps the most interesting fact about sharks in general, is that they are OLDER than trees! Oxygen was created in the oceans via algae way before trees came into existence. In fact, they still produce more oxygen than trees do today.</p>
